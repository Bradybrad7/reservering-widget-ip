## 🔜 Ready for Backend Integration

The system is **ready for real backend integration**. To connect to your API:

1. Replace mock API calls in `src/services/apiService.ts`
2. Add actual HTTP requests (fetch/axios)
3. Update endpoints to match your backend
4. Add authentication headers as needed

**Example:**
```typescript
// Current (Mock)
async getAdminEvents(): Promise<ApiResponse<AdminEvent[]>> {
  await delay(300);
  return { success: true, data: mockDB.getEvents() };
}

// Future (Real API)
async getAdminEvents(): Promise<ApiResponse<AdminEvent[]>> {
  const response = await fetch('/api/admin/events', {
    headers: { 'Authorization': `Bearer ${token}` }
  });
  return await response.json();
}
```
